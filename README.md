# Smart Home IoT Network (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project simulates a smart home network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes IoT devices, a local server, home gateway, and internet connectivity through a DSL modem.

## 🗂️ Files Included
- `smart_home.pkt` – The main Packet Tracer project
- `network_diagram.png` – Network architecture diagram
- `device_configs.txt` – CLI configurations for routers/switches
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

## 🌐 Network Features
- IoT devices (smart light, motion detector, etc.)
- DHCP, DNS, and Web Server configurations
- Secure local server for device control
- Internet simulation using cloud ➝ DSL ➝ router

## 🧪 How to Test
1. Open `smart_home.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Run the simulation mode to see IoT device communication
3. Access local web server via browser on tablet/PC device
4. Ping from router to test internet connectivity
